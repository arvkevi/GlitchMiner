**GlitchMiner** is a robust framework designed to detect glitch tokens—tokens that cause unexpected behaviors in large language models (LLMs). These anomalies can severely impact model outputs, particularly in sensitive applications such as healthcare or finance.

[Read our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15052) for detailed insights.

## 🧐 What are Glitch Tokens?

**Glitch tokens** are errors within LLMs that can trigger:
- **Incorrect outputs:** Misleading information in critical decision-making.
- **Hallucinated content:** Unreliable or irrelevant responses.
- **Security risks:** Exposure to potential adversarial attacks.

### Causes of Glitch Tokens:
- **Inadequate training data** for certain tokens.
- **Suboptimal token embeddings** affecting model performance.
- **Rare token occurrences** that the model fails to handle properly.

## 🔍 How GlitchMiner Works

**GlitchMiner** uses gradient-based discrete optimization to identify glitch tokens effectively, enhancing both the security and reliability of LLMs.

### Key Features:
- **Entropy Maximization:** Targets tokens where the model's output is most uncertain.
- **Gradient-Guided Search:** Employs model gradients to pinpoint potential glitches.
- **Dynamic Token Filtering:** Refines the focus on relevant tokens, improving search efficiency.
- **Support for Multiple Models:** Compatible with popular models like Llama, Qwen, and Gemma.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Install GlitchMiner with pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/wooozihui/GlitchMiner.git
```

### Usage Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from glitchminer import GlitchMiner
import time

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model_path = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
            model_path,
            device_map="cuda",
            torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        )
    start_time = time.time()

    # Run GlitchMiner for glitch token detection
    glitch_tokens, glitch_token_ids = GlitchMiner(
        model,
        tokenizer,
        num_iterations=125,
        batch_size=8,
        k=32,
        if_print=True,
        print_language="CN",
    )
```

## Strictly Glitch Token Verification
To eliminate false positives, we recommend using the `strictly_glitch_verification` function for cross-validation.
```python
    from glitchminer import strictly_glitch_verification
    glitch_count, verified_glitch_ids = strictly_glitch_verification(model, tokenizer, glitch_token_ids)
    print(glitch_count)
```
